Description: This package implements a supervised predictive classifier underpartition echangeability due to J.F.C. Kingman (1978). The two classifiers implemented are a Naive Bayes classifier that assumes test datais i.i.d., and a more computationally costly but more accurate simultaneous classifier that tries to find a labeling for the entire test dataset at once. Also included in this package are functions to simulate samples and gain sample probabilities from the Ewens sampling formula, also known as the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. Finally, parameter estimation and a simple hypothesis test for the distribution are included.
